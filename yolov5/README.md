# YOLOv5 with Obfuscation 🕵️‍♂️🔒

(*Privacy, Confidentiality and other Ethical implications of image/video obfuscation*)

This repository is a modified version of the Ultralytics YOLOv5 repository. It includes additional functionality for obfuscating certain classes of objects in images or videos.

## Visual Examples and Videos 📷

(*Before and after obfuscation*)

## Modified Files 📂
The following files in the YOLOv5 repository have been modified to support obfuscation:

```plaintext
yolov5
├── segment
│   ├── predict.py (this file was changed/adpated to support obsfucation)
│   └── safe_layer.py (this file contains obsfucation functions)
└── ...

```
## Dependencies 📦

## Usage (not tested on a different machine yet...) 📋

To use this repository, you must first clone it using the following command 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CIIC-C-T-Polytechnic-of-Leiria/SafeAR
```

To use this repository, you must first install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can run the obfuscation using the `predict.py` script in the segment directory. The script takes several command-line arguments:

`--weights`: Path to the weights file for the model.  
`--source`: Path to the input data (image or video).  
`--view-img`: Include this flag to display the image/video window during inference.  
`--classes`: List of class (number `0` to `79`) indices to detect and obfuscate (refer to this [file](data/coco128-seg.yaml)).  
`--policy`: Obfuscation policy (`'mask'`, `'blur'`, or `'pixelate'`) to apply to the detected objects. 

 
## Example of usage 🚀
Here's an example command that runs the `'mask'` obfuscation policy on class `0` (i.e., "person" class) in the video "path/to/video.mp4:


```bash
python segment/predict.py --weights yolov5n-seg.pt --source path/to/video.mp4 --view-img --classes 0 --policy "mask"
```
This command will display the video with the specified obfuscation applied.
