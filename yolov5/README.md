# YOLOv5 with Obfuscation üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîí



(*Privacy, Confidentiality and other Ethical implications of image/video obfuscation*)

This repository is a modified version of the [Ultralytics YOLOv5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). It includes additional functionality for obfuscating certain classes of objects in images or videos.

## To Do List üìù
- [x] Implement obfuscation functionality with different policies (masking, blur, pixelation) 
- [ ] Implement diferent obfuscation policies to different classes
- [ ] Measure segmentation accuracy and inferencing time
- [ ] Evaluate performance under adversarial attacks
- [ ] Implement a GUI to select the obfuscation policy and classes to obfuscate?

## Visual Examples and Videos üì∑

(*Before and after obfuscation*)

## Modified Files üìÇ
The following files in the YOLOv5 repository have been modified to support obfuscation:

```plaintext
yolov5
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ segment
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ predict.py (this file was changed/adpated to support obsfucation)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ safe_layer.py (this file contains obsfucation functions)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

```
## Dependencies üì¶
(*to complete*)

## Usage (not tested on a different machine yet...) üìã

To use this repository, you must first clone it using the following command 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CIIC-C-T-Polytechnic-of-Leiria/SafeAR
```

To use this repository, you must first install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can run the obfuscation using the `predict.py` script in the segment directory. The script takes several command-line arguments:

`--weights`: Path to the weights file for the model.  
`--source`: Path to the input data (image or video).  
`--view-img`: Include this flag to display the image/video window during inference.  
`--classes`: List of class (number `0` to `79`) indices to detect and obfuscate (refer to this [file](data/coco128-seg.yaml)).  
`--policy`: Obfuscation policy (`'mask'`, `'blur'`, or `'pixelate'`) to apply to the detected objects. 

 
## Example of usage üöÄ
Here's an example command that runs the `'mask'` obfuscation policy on class `0` (i.e., "person" class) in the video "path/to/video.mp4:


```bash
python segment/predict.py --weights yolov5n-seg.pt --source path/to/video.mp4 --view-img --classes 0 --policy "mask"
```
This command will display the video with the specified obfuscation applied.
